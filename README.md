# _The Spellbound Mod_

Created for ModJam 3 by the _MCA Dev Team_, _WildBamaBoy_ and _SheWolfDeadly_. Adds over 40 magic spells to the game, including combat spells, teleportation, and time control.

This is a temporary repository. It will be transferred to a new repository once voting on ModJam 3 has concluded.

## Project Setup

Spellbound is built for Minecraft v1.6.4 using MinecraftForge v9.11.0.886. Compatibility with an older version cannot be guaranteed.

Setup is a simple drag-and-drop of the folders and files at Forge/mcp/src/minecraft/ in this repository to the corresponding mcp/src/minecraft/ folder in your installation of the Minecraft Coder's Pack.

After copying assets and code, open the MCP generated Eclipse workspace and Spellbound will be ready for debugging, editing, etc.
